# Machine Learing Specialization-University of Washington
This Specialization provides a case-based introduction to the exciting, high-demand field of machine learning. You’ll learn to analyze large and complex datasets, build applications that can make predictions from data, and create systems that adapt and improve over time. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to solve an original, real-world problem through implementation of machine learning algorithms.
